"""Cut one voice's film out of the raw feature take: the still stretches go, cues shift.

    cut-idle.py <raw.webm> <cues.json> <idle.json> <out.mkv> <out-cues.json>

The recorder films while it synthesizes each line in every voice and while a script pauses,
and it holds every shot until the SLOWEST voice has said its line — so the raw take is a
frozen screen for seconds per cue (eval run 14: 120 s of silence in a 168 s film).
`idle.json` lists the stretches the recorder measured, in seconds on the cue clock. On top of
those, each cue's `hold` minus this voice's own `speech` is cut, so a fast voice is not left
waiting in silence for a slow one. `cues.json` carries the voice being cut (its `speech`);
the output cues are the same cues on the cut clock. No stretch to cut: copied unchanged.
