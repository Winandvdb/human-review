"""The deployed-app row has four states and none of them is in the markup.

Everything the reader sees in that row — "Offline" or an address, which of `Start` and `Stop`
are on screen, `Reset DB`, and whether each verb wears a clipboard or its own
mark — is decided at runtime by APP_ENV_JS and SERVER_JS out of two facts neither can know
at build time: whether this copy of the report is being served, and whether anything is
answering at the base. So the markup tests in `test_build_review.py` can only pin what is
*available*; what is actually *shown* needs a browser, which is what this file is.

The stubs are the two facts and nothing else: `window.HR.can()` decides served, and a
replaced `fetch` decides live. The script under test is the real one, inlined from the
build module, so a change to it is caught here rather than in a review of the diff.
