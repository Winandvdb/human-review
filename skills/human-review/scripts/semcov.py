"""Semantic test coverage: the Tests tab's ticket↔tests matrix, drawn by a script.

The matrix used to be a model's whole output — `requirements-map.html` and a `test-index/`
catalogue, ~180KB of HTML, CSS and JavaScript written fresh on every paid run, and a run on
another harness invented a layout of its own. Everything in it except one judgement can be
derived, so it now is:

1. **The ticket, left.** The issue body (`gh issue view`, cached in `ticket-body.json`),
   rendered from its markdown — paragraphs, headings, the numbered requirement list as the
   ticket has it — and split into sentences, each with an id derived from its own words
   (`s` + 6 hex of a hash), so an edit elsewhere in the ticket does not re-key it.
2. **The tests, right.** The tests whose per-test coverage (`testcov.py` →
   `assets/test-coverage.json`: JaCoCo, Karma/Istanbul, V8) runs a line this PR changed,
   with their kind (UI/API/unit), name, file and what the branch did to them
   (`test-changes.py`). Without a coverage run, the tests the branch added or changed.
3. **The pairing.** Mostly scripted (`match`): a sentence and a test are paired on shared
   evidence — words of the test's name and body, normalised and stemmed, a small table of
   synonyms that maps a ticket's verbs onto a test's (`booking` ↔ `create`/`post`, `clear`
   ↔ `null`), numbers and quoted literals, routes, and the identifiers on the changed lines
   the test's coverage actually ran. Every link carries the evidence it was made on. Only
   the sentences the script cannot pair go to a cheap model (`rerun-model.py`, haiku by
   default), with their few candidate tests; its answer is `test-mapping.json`, validated
   against `reference/test-mapping.schema.json`, and merged here.
4. **The page.** Deterministic: the same four inputs give the same bytes. The renderer
   (`reqmap/reqmap.css`, `reqmap/reqmap.js`) is the one the demo PR's model wrote, lifted
   verbatim, so the tab looks exactly as it did; `hrbuild/tabs/tests.py:reqmap_layout`
   re-lays it the same way it always has.

    semcov.py inputs   --dir .human-review   # what the model would be asked, as JSON
    semcov.py match    --dir .human-review   # the scripted pairing, as JSON
    semcov.py render   --dir .human-review   # write assets/requirements-map.html
    semcov.py validate --dir .human-review   # check test-mapping.json
    semcov.py agreement --dir D --reference OLD.html   # pairs vs a model-written matrix

# A sentence of a ticket and a test of a suite are written by different people in
# different registers — "Booking a visit lets you not choose a vet" against
# `create_withoutVet_leavesItUnassigned` — and the whole of this pass is making the two
# comparable: split identifiers, drop the words every sentence and every test has, stem
# what is left, and fold a short table of synonyms onto one concept each. What survives
# is weighted by how rare it is across the tests on the card (a word every test shares
# pins nothing), and a link is made only on a rare word, never on a common one alone.

# Eval run 8's Haiku answer called 25 of 27 sentences `covered` and none `partial`:
# "authorization … and chatbot/MCP contracts SHALL remain unchanged" stood on a test that
# lists owners, "Bootstrap styling remains" on two DOM checks, and one `confirm` gave a reason
# its test does not have. The model stays cheap; what it says is now *checked*, by two
# passes that can only take away. `sanity` is free: a link whose test shares no specific
# word, route or identifier with its sentence cannot be evidence for it. `check_input` /
# `apply_check` are a second cheap call that re-reads every kept link against the test body,
# must quote the line that asserts the claim (and the quote is looked up in the real body),
# and whose verdicts are applied only where they lower a link or a sentence.
