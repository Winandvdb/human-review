# --- the matrix's own layout -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The requirements↔tests matrix is the one fragment on this tab the build does not write:
# a model renders `assets/requirements-map.html` and the section pastes it in whole. What
# the model may decide is what the matrix *says* — which test covers which sentence, and
# how honestly. Where the two columns sit, and what is written over them, is not that kind
# of question: it is the same answer on every branch, in every repository, and a layout
# that comes back slightly different after each paid run is a page the reader has to learn
# again. So the frame is taken back here, deterministically, on every build.
#
# Three things move, and all three are the same correction — *a key is read once, a title
# is read first*:
#
#   * the ticket's **title** goes over the ticket. It was nowhere on the page: the masthead
#     carries the PR's title, which on this branch is not the issue's, and the ticket frame
#     opens straight into `victorrentea opened on Jun 13, 2026` with nothing saying what
#     was opened. It is a link to the issue, because the reader's next question after
#     reading four sentences of a ticket is the rest of it;
#   * the **colour legend** (`fully covered … N/A`) goes under the ticket it explains;
#   * the **UI/API/unit key** goes on the title row, over the card it explains, level
#     with the ticket's title — the one stretch of that row that was empty — and each of
#     its three words becomes a checkbox that filters the card's rows by kind.
#
# Nothing else moves. The card's own header strip — the robot, *Covering tests*, *as
# matched by AI* — stays inside the card, where it is the exact counterpart of the strip
# the ticket wears: two frames, each headed by who wrote what is in it. Lifting it out to
# pair it with the ticket's title *looked* symmetrical and was not — it left the right-hand
# frame bare-topped while the left kept its strip, and stacked on a narrow window it
# stranded the card's byline a screen above the card.
#
# The title is made a child of `.rm-body` rather than of the left column, and that is the
# whole of the alignment: it is a grid row of its own, spanning nothing on the right, so
# the row under it starts both columns together. The two frames are level by construction —
# at any width, with no measured constant to keep in step. There was such a constant
# (`--rm-key-h:25px`, "measured: the pill row draws 24.7px, the text row 23px") and it is
# exactly the kind of number that goes stale the first time a font changes.

#: The resolved ticket, cached under the report directory. The build must not need a
#: network to draw a title it drew yesterday — and `gh` is not available to every reader
#: of this repository at all. Asked once, written down, read from disk ever after.

#: Which cells of the matrix are cut to fit, and therefore need somewhere for the rest of
#: the words to live. `.rm-tt` is the covering test's name, and it is the only column in
#: the fragment whose content is a sentence: nine of them were cut on this project's own
#: PR — *"The vet chosen while booking is named everywhere the visit i…"*, 42 % of it on
#: screen — and two UNIT rows for two different components collapsed to nearly the same
#: visible string.
REQMAP_CUT = ".reqmap .rm-tt"

#: The hover on a name the matrix had to cut, measured at the moment it is asked for.
#:
#: Not written into the markup at build time, because the build cannot know: whether a
#: name fits is a question about the reader's window, their font and which column the
#: layout gave it, and the honest answer changes when they drag the window. A `data-tip`
#: stamped on every row regardless would also put a tooltip on the rows that are NOT cut,
#: where it repeats, word for word, the text the pointer is already resting on.
#:
#: Not an observer either. `.rm-tt` lives in a fragment a model renders, inside a tab
#: panel that is `display:none` until the reader opens it — where `scrollWidth` and
#: `clientWidth` are both 0 and nothing looks truncated. Anything measuring ahead of time
#: therefore has to be told when the panel appears, when the fragment's own script has
#: finished writing rows, and when the window resizes; three subscriptions to get one
#: attribute right.
#:
#: So it is measured on the way in. The listener is on `document` in the CAPTURE phase,
#: which is what puts it ahead of `TIP_JS`'s own delegated `pointerover` on the same
#: document — by the time the tooltip asks `closest('[data-tip]')`, the attribute is
#: either there or gone. `focusin` alongside it, for a reader arriving by keyboard.
#: The switch's one line of behaviour: the reqmap wears `data-semcov="off"` while the box is
#: unchecked, and the stylesheet does the rest. Delegated on `document` like the hover, so
#: it survives a fragment's own script rewriting rows under it. Not emitted on the give-up
#: path: the switch is on the row this function draws, and a fragment it declined to
#: rewrite has no such row.

# the page last recorded is a claim about the tree as it was at that run. So this tab has
# a third press, free and slow — every producer that feeds the tab, the suite-running ones
# included, with the step cache bypassed so a suite whose inputs look unchanged runs anyway.
#
# The declaration lives here because *which* producers are "the tests" is this tab's
# knowledge. Drawing the button beside the other two, routing it through the server's
# rerun lock and teaching the page's rerun machine its id belong to the shared modules
# (`shared/commands.py:tab_rerun_html`, `shared/actions.py`, `assets/server.js`,
