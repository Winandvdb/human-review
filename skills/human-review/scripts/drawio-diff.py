drawio-diff — what a branch adds to a hand-drawn draw.io diagram.

Compares two `.drawio.png` files (or the mxGraph XML inside them) by the identity
each element *declares* in the XML — `concept="Owner"` on a box, `assoc="Owner-Pet"`
on a line, the mxCell `id` otherwise — never by rendered pixels. Moving a box does
not make it a different box, and renaming its drawn label does not either.

    ./drawio-diff.py old.drawio.png new.drawio.png --out-dir assets --name conceptual
    ./drawio-diff.py --base origin/main --diagram docs/ConceptualModel.drawio.png \
        --out-dir .human-review/assets --name conceptual

Writes three SVGs — `<name>-original.svg`, `<name>-new.svg`, `<name>-diff.svg` — plus
`<name>-diff.json` with the machine-readable verdict, and prints a one-line summary.

Two colours, two meanings, and they must not be conflated:

  * **red** is the diagram's own. The patch script paints an element red when it draws
    it to keep `ConceptualModelDiagramTest` green, and it stays red until a human
    re-lays it out by hand. It is a to-do, and it is read off the file, not inferred.
  * **green** is this tool's. It marks what the revision adds against the base — the
    same green the rest of the report spends on "added", never a second one.

An element that is both — automation drew it *and* it is new — renders red: the
to-do is the louder fact, and it subsumes "new". Turn it black by hand in draw.io and
this tool paints it green, because it is still new. That transition is the whole
contract.

The to-do is meant to be acted on, so the verdict carries `drawio_url` — a
`drawio://<absolute path>` the report renders as a link *under* the drawing, in HTML,
where a link can look like one. Nothing is painted onto the picture to say so. macOS
ships no such scheme — `install-drawio-url-handler.sh` next to this file registers one.

Rendering goes through the draw.io desktop app when it is installed, which is the only
way to get a *faithful* picture (and, as a bonus, one that carries `light-dark()` for
both themes). Without it, a built-in renderer walks the mxGeometry — boxes, straight
edges, labels — which is enough for this class of diagram.

Requires: nothing. draw.io.app is used when present.

#               this is the emphasis a reviewer wants — where the real traffic is.
#   * not walked — every other arrow: a human using the frontend, a hop with no agent on
#               it, or a call no test exercises any more. Greyed, never removed: the
#               drawing may well be right, and the tests silent.

    "Back to what this branch committed" was the wrong target, and it failed the first
    time it was pressed. A hand edit does not sit in the work tree waiting to be undone:
    it gets swept into the next commit that touches the file, usually one made for some
    other reason, and from then on HEAD *is* the mess. `git stash push` then finds nothing
    to save, exits 0, and the reader watches a button do nothing.

    So the undo walks back instead, and the step it takes is one *drawing*, never one
    commit. The two are not the same thing here: a `.drawio.png` is re-rendered by
    machinery — a PNG whose bytes move while every box stays where it was — and stepping
    onto one of those would be the same no-op wearing a different sha. `diff_models` is
    what already knows the difference, so it is what decides.

    That makes the offer repeatable, which is what an undo is: each press lands on a
    drawing, the next press steps past it to the one before, and a reader who has gone one
    step too far can read the sha in the fold and walk forward by hand.

    Red decides where it lands. The patch script paints what it draws red and leaves it
    red until a human lays it out, so a drawing with no red left is one somebody has
    worked on — and "undo my edits" means that work, not the commit that happens to sit
    one step below it. The walk therefore prefers the newest earlier drawing that still
    carries red, and falls back to simply the newest earlier drawing when none does.

    "Past it" is why the walk starts from where the file already stands rather than from
    the top. Once a press has landed, the drawing just left behind is the newest one that
    differs — so a search that always started at HEAD would answer the second press with
    the thing the first press undid, and the offer would rock between two revisions
    forever. Pressing undo twice means *further back*, never *never mind*.
