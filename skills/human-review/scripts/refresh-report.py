"""Rebuild and re-serve an existing review page, without asking a model anything.

`/human-review` has two halves that have never been separable by hand, and were therefore
run together every time somebody wanted a page refreshed:

  * **the model's half** — the findings, the prose, and the pairing of the ticket's
    sentences with tests that the script could not decide (`test-mapping.json`; the Tests
    tab's matrix itself is drawn by `semcov.py`, here, from it). Slow, paid for, and *not
    reproducible*: a second pass over
    the same diff words and ranks its findings differently, so re-running it does not
    confirm the first one, it replaces it. It runs when the human asks for it, never as a
    side effect of anything else;
  * **the programs** — the diagram deltas, the Code City shot, the complexity increment, the
    contract diff, the logging scan, the test manifest, the recordings, and the build of the
    HTML itself. Fixed inputs, fixed outputs, safe to run again at any time.

This is the second half, as one command. Run it after *any* change that the page should
show: an edit to `build-review-html.py`, a fix in the branch under review, a new commit, a
tweak to `content.json`. It never writes the model's half and never calls a model — a
logging statement whose privacy verdict is not already in the cache renders as *not
evaluated* rather than quietly buying an answer.

    refresh-report.py                     # rebuild the page and serve it
    refresh-report.py --steps cheap       # …after re-running the fast producers
    refresh-report.py --steps static      # …after re-running the ones that need nothing up
    refresh-report.py --steps all         # …after re-running every producer, heavy included
    refresh-report.py --steps diagrams,tests
    refresh-report.py --no-serve          # write the file, print nothing to open

It refuses to build in two cases, and both are the same principle: a page must not assert
something the repository contradicts. The first is a **missing model-written part** — the
layout, the model's half of the sentence↔test pairing. Those are not steps this
program can re-run, and a page without them is not a smaller page, it is the same page
with its argument deleted. The second is a **commit claiming a `review-points.md` that is
not on disk**: the branch says it recorded its own review and the file is gone, so the
band reading *nothing records what was reviewed* would be true of the disk and false about
the run.

The film's script (`feature-script.js`) is the other model-written artifact — +1 LLM script
beside the matrix — and it too is never written here: `rerun-film.py` is the command that
does. But it is not a refusal when it is missing. No script is no film, a state the `video`
step and the Demo tab already name, not a page with its argument deleted.

#: correctly, as "did the step that produces it run?".

#: assumed — written by a model at the end of a review and corroborated by nothing outside
#: itself. That record now belongs to the branch: `/record-review` writes
#: `review-points.md`, commits it with the fixes, and the content file asks for the three
#: piles with `{"auto": "review-points"}`. What is left in it is the *layout* and the
#: *ledes* — which tabs the page has, in what order, and the sentences over them. Still a
