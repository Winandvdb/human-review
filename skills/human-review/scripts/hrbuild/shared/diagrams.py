    """The Diff / New-Old control and its panes — the ONE implementation of it.

    `panes` is an ordered list of `(view, inner-html)` with `"diff"` first. Three states
    off two buttons: the second holds both words and toggles between them, with the live
    one underlined, because a third pill costs as much room as the two that carry the
    argument and this control has to sit above a tall sequence diagram as comfortably as
    above a small structural one.

    `initial` is which of the three the widget opens on. It is "diff" for a *structural*
    diagram, where the delta is a clean two-colour drawing and the whole point of the
    section. Two callers pass "new" instead, for the same reason in two guises: the delta
    is not trustworthy enough to be the first thing read. The UX audit's is a pixel mask
    over a screenshot, and a half-ghosted photo of a form has to be decoded before it says
    anything; a sequence diagram's is drawn from traces, and a run that reorders two
    concurrent calls — or a generator that relabels an arrow — is reported as a change
    nobody made. In both cases the undiffed picture is the one that reads at a glance, and
    the delta stays one click away for when the question is what moved.

    Callers: `render_diagrams` below, for every PlantUML delta, and `drawio_widget_html`,
    for the hand-drawn conceptual model. Behaviour and styling live in `DGM_VIEWS_JS` / the
    stylesheet and are delegated off `document`, so a widget that lands in a section body
    is driven by the same code as one emitted here — a second implementation of this would
    drift within a week.
