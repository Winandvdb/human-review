# Film the feature working, in a real browser, for the review guide.
#
# The first version of this replayed the Playwright acceptance test and kept its video.
# That is the purer idea — the test IS the demo — but headless it finishes in ~1s and the
# retained .webm shows only the final assertion, which tells a reviewer nothing about the
# interaction. So this drives the flow through the same selectors the e2e suite uses,
# deliberately slowed, and records the whole thing: the point of the video is to be
# watched, and the test still guards the behaviour.
#
# It tours every page the change touched, not just the one where the feature is entered —
# a reviewer's next question after "does it work" is always "where else does this show up".
#
# Playwright does not record the mouse pointer, so raw footage never tells you WHERE the
# thing being narrated is. Each say() therefore takes the element it is about and stores
# its on-screen box on the cue; annotate-feature-video.py turns those into a spotlight and
# burns the narration into the frame. Coordinates are viewport-relative and the video is
# recorded at the viewport size, so they are frame pixels 1:1 — the run prints the
# devicePixelRatio and viewport it actually got, which is what makes that safe to assume.
#
# Each cue is also SPOKEN, by the offline macOS speech synthesizer, before it is filmed. That
# is not decoration: the synthesizer reports when it says each word, which is what lets the
# captions light up word by word in time with the voice. It also fixes the pacing problem the
# hardcoded pauses below could never solve — a pause tuned for reading a sentence is not the
# time it takes to say it — so every pause() is now a MINIMUM, stretched when the narration
# needs longer, and say() itself returns only once its sentence has been spoken. Set NARRATION=off to film silently; NARRATION_VOICE / NARRATION_RATE pick the
# voice (`say -v "?"` lists them) and its speed. With a Fish Audio key (see narrate-cue.py) the
# cues are ALSO spoken by each cloned voice in NARRATION_FISH_VOICES — by default 🐘 (Trump)
# and Discovery (a nature-documentary narrator) — and one more film is cut from the same take
# per voice (<out>.voice-<key>.webm). The Demo tab offers them as radio buttons under the
# player, and only the voices that made it into a film. Every shot lasts as long as the
# LONGEST of the sentences, so all the films fit one take. NARRATION_FISH=off skips them all.
# NARRATION_FISH_VOICES is a JSON list of {"key", "label", "id", "tip"?}, `id` a Fish Audio
# model, `tip` the speaker's name the Demo tab shows on hover — left off the 🐘 on purpose.
#
# The film OPENS ON A TITLE CARD — "Demo" over the name of the change being reviewed — and it
# is filmed, not spliced on afterwards. Splicing was the obvious build: render a card, concat
# it in front with ffmpeg. It is also the one that silently rots, because the cue clock IS the
# video clock. `<out>.cues.json` timestamps are what the guide's transcript uses to seek the
# player, what annotate-feature-video.py hangs the burnt-in captions and spotlights off, and
# where it places each spoken .wav in the mixed narration track. Prepending N seconds of
# picture shifts all three, each needing its own +N, and a single one forgotten gives you the
# worst possible outcome: a film that looks right and narrates the wrong shot. Filming the
# card inside the take makes N zero everywhere — the timestamps are correct by construction —
# and sidesteps the whole matching problem (resolution, frame rate, pixel format, codec) that
# a concat has to get right, since the card is the same stream Playwright is already writing.
# The cost is that the recorder now stages one screen of its own, which it was already doing
# for the viewport, the pacing and the spotlights.
#
# The card's words come from the DATA, never from a literal here: the guide's own title
# (`.human-review/content.json`), else the branch's PR title, else the branch name — so the
# next run's film names the next run's change. $HUMAN_REVIEW_VIDEO_TITLE and
# $HUMAN_REVIEW_VIDEO_SUBTITLE override, and TITLE_CARD=off films without one.
#
# Usage:
#   .claude/skills/human-review/scripts/record-feature-video.sh <out.webm>
#
# Writes, next to <out.webm>:
#   <out>.cues.json  the narration, timestamped as the run happens (plus each cue's box, its
#                    spoken .wav and the time of every word in it), so the guide can build a
#                    transcript that seeks the player
#   <out>.raw.webm   the same film without the annotations or the voice
#   <out>.voice-<key>.webm  the same film in one cloned voice, listed with its label in
#                    <out>.voices.json — a voice only when every spoken cue got it; a run
#                    without a key deletes them all
#   <out>.narration/ one .wav per cue (and fish/<key>/, the cloned ones), kept so the film can be re-annotated without re-filming,
#                    plus `lead` — how long the title card holds the screen, which is the one
#                    number annotate-feature-video.py cannot recover from the footage and the
#                    reason a re-annotation does not print the first caption over the card

# machine keeps several checkouts of the same repository and any of them can serve
# :4200, so on 17 Sep 2026 a review of `test-pr` was illustrated with a film of `main`:
# the narration was generated from this branch's diff and the frames came from another
# one, and every caption asserted something the picture denied. The film is the one
# artifact on the page a reader believes without opening anything, so it is the one that

# build writes build-info; $HUMAN_REVIEW_APP_COMMIT_URL points at anything else that can
# answer. A mismatch is fatal (exit 2, same as a stack that is down — the film cannot be
# made), and short-vs-full sha is compared by prefix, either way round, because which of
# the two a project publishes is not this script's business.
#
# An app that cannot say is NOT fatal: plenty of builds have no build-info, and refusing
# them would take the film away from every project that never had this bug. It warns, and
# the warning is louder when nothing in this run started the stack — that being exactly
# the case where what is listening is anyone's guess.

[video] no feature script — nothing to film, so step 5 is skipped (say so in the guide).

Write one at .human-review/feature-script.js (or human-review-feature.js at the repo
root, or point $HUMAN_REVIEW_FEATURE_SCRIPT at it). It exports one async function:

  module.exports = async ({page, say, pause, get, app, apiUrl}) => {
    await page.goto(`${app}/some/screen`);
    const thing = page.locator("#the-new-thing");
    await thing.waitFor();                       // ← say() asserts; this is the assertion
    await say("This is the new part.", thing);   // spoken, captioned, spotlit
    await pause(2000);                           // a FLOOR; the narration may stretch it
    return {ok: true, note: "one line for the run summary"};
  };

Wait for the element BEFORE you narrate it. say() takes it only to draw a spotlight, so a
locator that matches nothing still speaks the sentence — over a screen that does not
contain the thing it names — and the film then looks like a normal demo. waitFor() turns
that into a throw; catch it per screen, collect the names, and report them in `note` as
`FAILED to reach: …`, which is the string run-steps.py reads back onto the page.

Return {ok:false} when the feature did not work: the film is still kept and the recorder
exits 3, because a film of the feature NOT working is the most valuable one it can make.
