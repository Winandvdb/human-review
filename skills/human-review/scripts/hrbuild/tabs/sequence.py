#: The kind above says which END the run was driven from; it does not say what a reader
#: has to open, or in what language, to change the thing. Two rows on this tab were both
#: `UI` — a Playwright spec and a Cucumber scenario — and nothing on the shut row told
#: them apart, though one of them is the only test on the page written in a language a
#: non-programmer reads.
#:
#: Read off the extension and nothing else, and that is not the same shortcut `_pair_cat`
#: refuses. The kind is a claim about what the run DID, which a path cannot answer. The
#: runner IS the file: `.feature` is Gherkin because Gherkin is what a `.feature` file
#: contains, and no diagram is needed to know it. Longest suffix first, so `.spec.ts` is
#: not read as a bare `.ts`. The Playwright spec says `TypeScript`, the language, to sit
#: beside `Gherkin` and `JUnit` as the thing a reader would have to read, not the tool
#: that runs it; the tool stays in the hover.

    in the next, and the page must not settle that by guessing at a path. The diagram is a
    record of what the run actually did, and its first lifeline is the end the test was
    driving from — `Browser` for a run through the screens, `Client` for a `@SpringBootTest`

    draws, so reading it off the picture keeps the badge and the tip from ever disagreeing.

    one isolated component, which is exactly what the Tests tab means by the word.

    they did not ask for to find out what is even on the tab. Closed, the tab opens on its
    own table of contents — one line per test — and the reader picks. The folding is done

    the reader could only answer by opening each one and looking at the top lifeline —

    would have taken all of them and the rest would have shown none.

    The split is derived, not authored. An excerpt is a set of line ranges in the content

    One excerpt often quotes two scenarios at once (`35-48,52-65` is one snippet in the

    getting only its own scenario's lines. Whole, both pairs quoted `34-64` and both

    """Whether the work tree's copy of `rel` is *not* what the review's base ref has.

    `render_testpairs` learns that a diagram changed by finding a row for it in
    `MANIFEST.tsv`, and the manifest is written by a producer — `puml-diff.sh`, run by the
    `diagrams` and `sequence` steps. Absence from it therefore has two meanings that look
    identical from here: the branch really left the diagram alone, or the manifest is
    older than the diagram. The second one happens in the ordinary way of working: the
    page is rebuilt without re-running the producers (`refresh-report.py` runs none by
    default, because most refreshes are a change to the *page*), and any `.genseq.puml`
    the acceptance suite regenerated in the meantime is then described by a manifest that
    predates it. The pair came out pilled UNCHANGED over a picture that differs from the
    base in every lifeline — a page asserting the opposite of what `git diff` says, with
    nothing on it admitting the claim was second-hand.

    So the claim is checked against the repository instead of inferred from an artifact.
    Against the merge-base with the base ref, not its tip, for the same reason
    `puml-diff.sh` uses it: commits that landed on the base after this branch started are
    not this branch's doing.

    `False` is also the answer when git cannot say — no repository, no such base ref, a
    checkout with no commits — and that is deliberate: the fixture-shaped cases are
    exactly the ones where "unchanged" was never a claim about a base to begin with, and
    turning them into a warning would be inventing a problem.
