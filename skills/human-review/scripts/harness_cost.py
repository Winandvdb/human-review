"""The four components of a change's bill, whichever harness spent each one.

A change reviewed with this toolkit is paid for four times, and the `$` tab names each:

  1. **implementation** — writing the code, up to `/record-review prepare`;
  2. **review** — finding: `prepare` → the reviewers done (their subagents included);
  3. **auto-fixes** — taking the review's advice: the reviewers done → the last `finish`,
     every `RR ci --push` round included;
  4. **this guide** — the page's own model work: the session that ran `/human-review`,
     plus the paid model steps it shelled out to (`.model-runs.json`, `.film-runs.json`).

1–3 are **recorded by `/record-review`** in the harness that ran them, into the committed
`review-cost.json` beside `review-points.md` (schema `reference/review-cost.schema.json`).
4 is recorded by the `/human-review` run itself into `.human-review/report-cost.json`, with
the wall-clock time of the run; a refresh adds its own time there and never its money. A
branch recorded before either file existed is *derived* instead, from the same stores, and
says so — the derivation is a scan, the record is a measurement.

Three harnesses, three stores, one entry shape:

  * **Claude Code** — `~/.claude/projects/**/<session>.jsonl`, priced at API list price by
    `review-cost.py`, which owns the prices and the dedupe; this module only picks windows.
  * **Copilot CLI** — `~/.copilot/session-store.db`, `assistant_usage_events` per model
    call: tokens, and `total_nano_aiu` (1e9 = one AI credit). Matched by `cwd` (the repo or
    one of its worktrees), branch and time, and by what the session was *for* — its summary
    and first prompt name `/record-review` or `/human-review`. The CLI exports no session id
    to the shell it runs (`COPILOT_AGENT_SESSION_ID` is read when set, which is only the
    cloud agent), so the match is the only link.
  * **VS Code Copilot Chat** — `workspaceStorage/<hash>/chatSessions/<id>.jsonl`, an op-log
    replayed into the chat; each request (one user turn) carries `copilotCredits`. A chat
    *forked* in VS Code copies its parent's requests, credits included, under new ids: they
    are deduped on `(responseTimestamp, elapsedMs)`, which the copy keeps.

Copilot is shown in AI credits, its native unit. Its dollar figure is GitHub's own billing
rate — `AIC_USD`, one credit = $0.01 since 22 Jul 2026, the rate the billing API's
`grossAmount` implies and `copilot-usage` converts with — which is a *billed* price, where
the Claude figures are *list-price equivalents*. The page says which is which.
