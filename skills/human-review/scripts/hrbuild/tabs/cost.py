    This was a chip in the scope bar with a breakdown hanging off it, and the chip
    answered the wrong question: *what did this page cost to make*. The question a reader
    arrives with is what the **change** cost, and producing the code is the larger half of
    it — on the branch this was built for, the conversation that wrote the feature cost
    nearly seven times the review that read it. A number that big is not a footnote on a
    bar of chips; it is its own tab, and it is the honest answer to "is this way of working
    worth it", which is the only reason anybody totals up an agent's bill at all.

    Every row is measured or says it is not. Three kinds of honesty the table has to keep:

      * **A window is not a fence.** The authoring row is costed between that conversation's
        first and last edit to these files. Work inside that window which belonged to
        something else is counted, and the row prints the window so the reader can see how
        wide it is rather than trusting a number that cannot be tightened.
      * **The passes are added once.** A review pass usually runs before the guide does, so
        its cost is outside the run's own total and is added; one fired mid-run is already
        inside it and is not. The ledger tells the two apart rather than assuming.
      * **A zero is not an absence.** A tab a script produced costs nothing to produce and
        says so in its own row; a tab nothing could measure says *that*, in words.
