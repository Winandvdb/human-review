"""Push the Review tab's three piles onto the pull request, as inline comments on the code.

The judgement is not made here. The agent that wrote `review-points.md` also writes
`.human-review/pr-comments.json` — the exact body of GitHub's *create a review* call
(`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/reviews`), one comment per item, each anchored on a
line of the diff and worded for the PR's own reader. This script only checks that payload
against the PR as it is *now* and sends it. No model, no rewording, no choosing.

Why the anchors are re-checked at push time and not trusted: the payload's lines are lines
of its `commit_id` (the commit `review-points.md` was recorded in), and the PR head has
usually moved since (a retouch, a merge from `main`). Every comment is sent with the PR
head as its `commit_id`, so every `line` / `start_line` is **carried from the payload's
commit to the head through the diff between the two** — the same hunks the page carries its
refs through (`review-points.py:map_line`) — and the `anchor` text is only the cross-check.
visit-has-vet posted `R__seed.sql:144-147` for a card quoting `142-145`, and
`VisitRestController.java:83` for one quoting `85`: its payload had been written against
`ce56d912`, a review commit of an earlier round, and the comments then chased that round's
anchor text to wherever it now sat. A comment on a line that is not in the diff is refused
by GitHub with a 422 that fails the whole review, so each one is resolved, in order:

  1. the carried line is in the diff                                 → posted there
  2. the diff removed the line, but the `anchor` text is in the diff → posted there ("moved")
  3. the file or the carried line is outside the diff, or the line is gone
                                                    → quoted in the review's summary body,
                                                      with a permalink to the exact lines

Every move and fallback is printed. Nothing is dropped: a finding GitHub cannot pin to a
line is in the review's summary, under *Not on a line of this diff*, with the permalink
(which GitHub renders as the code itself), and the page's *on GitHub ↗* goes there.

**Re-pushing updates, it never duplicates.** Each body ends with a hidden marker,
`<!-- hr:A:vet-id-is-on-delete-set-null -->` — the pile letter and a slug of the item's
`###` title — and before posting the script lists the PR's review comments and PATCHes the
ones already carrying a marker instead of posting them again. The review's own body carries
`<!-- hr:review:<commit> -->`, the payload's commit, so a later round of review gets a
summary of its own instead of overwriting an earlier round's. GitHub cannot move a comment:
one that now belongs on other lines (or in the summary) is **deleted and re-posted** — but
only when the previous push's record (`pr-comments.posted.json`) lists it as this
pipeline's; any other comment is left where it is, and the script says so.

After a push, `.human-review/pr-comments.posted.json` records each marker's `html_url`, so
the page can put a link to its GitHub comment beside every item.

`--from-review-points` writes the payload deterministically out of `review-points.md` —
for a branch whose agent predates this file. It is the fallback, not the flow: the agent's
own payload is shorter, better anchored and worded for the PR, which is why it is asked for.

Usage:
  push-pr-comments.py --check                     # validate the payload against HEAD's diff
  push-pr-comments.py --dry-run                   # print the exact gh calls; post nothing
  push-pr-comments.py                             # post / update them on the branch's PR
  push-pr-comments.py --from-review-points        # (re)write the payload from review-points.md
  push-pr-comments.py --drop-stale                # rebuild/drop a payload from another branch
  push-pr-comments.py --pr 49 --repo victorrentea/petclinic --dry-run

Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 bad payload / no PR · 3 no payload file · 4 a GitHub call failed.
