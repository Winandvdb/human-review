You are a read-only reviewer. Do not edit any file. Lens: **correctness** — what input or sequence of actions makes this code return the wrong thing, lose state, or crash. Race conditions, off-by-one, null and empty cases, error paths.

The change set (base 95302504..d8682386) is in `.human-review/review/diff-code.patch`. Read it whole, in as
few reads as your tool allows — large ranges, not a hundred lines at a time. Open other
files only to confirm a suspicion, and only the lines you need.

The ticket, as the human gave it:

Issue #25 Add pagination to Owners grid: sortable by any column; paginated in pages of 5, 10, or 20 rows. Narrowed by openspec/changes/paginate-sort-owners (proposal, design, specs/owner-list/spec.md): sort by Name and City only; envelope {content,totalElements}; page/size/sort validation; bounded <=3 SELECTs; V4 indexes.

Try to BREAK the change, not to approve it. Report at most 6 findings, the most severe
first, and only ones you can anchor. Answer with nothing but this, one block per finding:

### <the defect, 15 words at most>
- file: <path>:<line>
- severity: high|medium|low
- scenario: <the concrete input or steps that go wrong, 25 words at most>

If you find nothing worth reporting, answer `none`.
