// The Sequence tab opens on its table of contents: every test pair folded shut, so the
// tab's first screen is one line per test instead of the top of whichever sequence happens
// to be first. A sequence is three or four screens of arrows; four of them stacked is a
// wall the reader has to scroll past to find out what is on the tab at all.
//
// Why here and not `<details>` without `open` in the markup, which is the obvious way: the
// click targets inside every diagram are transparent rects sized from `getBBox()`, and
// `getBBox()` on anything inside a `display:none` subtree returns zeros. A pair born shut
// would cost its sequence every handle on it, silently. So the pairs are born open, every
// script that measures them runs, and the folding happens after — the same bargain TABS_JS
// makes with the panels, for the same reason, and this runs before it for the same one.
//
// A reader arriving on a deep link is the exception: the pair the link names is what they
// asked for, and it stays open.
//
// Which pair is open is in the URL, both ways round. A reader who opens one and sends the
// address sends the picture they are looking at, not the tab it is on — the same handle
// the ⇥ on the Tests tab already jumps through. `replaceState`, not `location.hash`,
// because assigning the hash scrolls the page out from under the click that caused it.
(function () {
  var wanted = decodeURIComponent((location.hash || '').slice(1));
  // Not scoped to a panel id: the tab this block lands on is named by the content file.
  document.querySelectorAll('details.testpair[open]').forEach(function (pair) {
    if (pair.id && pair.id === wanted) return;
    pair.open = false;
  });

  function remember(id) {
    if (history.replaceState) history.replaceState(null, '', '#' + id);
    else location.hash = id;
  }

  document.querySelectorAll('details.testpair[id]').forEach(function (pair) {
    // `toggle` fires asynchronously, so the folding above arrives here too — harmlessly:
    // a pair being shut only rewrites the hash when the hash is naming that very pair,
    // which at load is true of the one pair this loop leaves open.
    pair.addEventListener('toggle', function () {
      var hash = decodeURIComponent((location.hash || '').slice(1));
      if (pair.open) remember(pair.id);
      else if (hash === pair.id) {

        remember(panel && panel.id ? panel.id : '');
      }
    });
  });

  // The row's file name is a link — to VS Code, at the scenario's line — and it sits inside
  // the pair's <summary>, so a click on it is also a click on the row: the reader would open
  // the file AND have the row fold open or shut under them.
  //
  // The fold is put back rather than the click stopped. `stopPropagation` is the usual
  // remedy and it is wrong here: the handler that opens a `vscode://` reference through the
  // served page's editor helper is a listener on `document`, so silencing the event on its
  // way there would trade one bug for a better-hidden one. This runs after the browser's own
  // activation behaviour and before the next paint, so a fold that never moved is left
  // alone and one that did is put back with nothing drawn in between.

  // The caption over the trace shot links to the pair of the test that trace belongs to,
  // and that pair is shut: a link to a shut fold scrolls to its one-line summary and stops,
  // which leaves the reader one click short of the diagram they were told to compare. Opened
  // here, before the browser follows the link, so the scroll lands on the open pair.
