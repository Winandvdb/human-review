"""Whose application the film is of, and what happens to the recorder's verdict.

Two failures, one day, one film.

`record-feature-video.sh` used to prove the stack was up by fetching `http://127.0.0.1:4200/`
and `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/pettypes` and checking that *something* answered. That is a
test of the port. This machine keeps three checkouts of one repository, each able to serve
:4200, so a review of `test-pr` was illustrated with a film of `main`: the narration was
generated from this branch's diff, the frames came from another branch, and every caption
asserted something the picture denied. The film is the one artifact on that page a reader
believes without opening anything.

And the recorder *said so*. It exited 3 — filmed, and the feature did not hold, three screens
never reached — and `run-steps.py` `_video` ran it without capturing anything, so the exit
code became a line in a status table that a human read once. The page showed the player with
no mark on it, because footage of a feature failing looks exactly like footage of one working.

So: the run owns its own instance where the project says how (`steps.video.app`), the recorder
refuses an application that reports a different commit, and every non-zero exit lands on disk
as a verdict the page draws over the player.

Run with:  python3 -m pytest test_feature_video_app.py
