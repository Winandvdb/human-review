"""`review-points.md` — what the agent fixed, declined and assumed — read into the three
piles the Review tab already renders.

The page has always been able to show what a review *found*: the passes leave findings in
the transcript and `review-passes.py` harvests them. What it could never show is what the
agent did with them — which finding it accepted, which it read and declined, and on what
grounds — because that decision is made in a conversation and then lost. Nor could it show
the readings the agent chose where the ticket was ambiguous, which are not in the diff at
all and are not findings: nobody found them, somebody decided them. Each of those carries
an optional `confidence:` — how sure the agent is that the reading it chose is the right
one — because "I decided this" and "I decided this and I may well be wrong" send a reviewer
to two different places, and only the agent that decided it can tell them apart.

`review-points.md` is that record, written by the agent while it still has it, committed
with the fixes, and therefore visible in the PR's own file list. This script turns it into
`.human-review/review-points.json`, whose `findings` / `autofixes` / `assumptions` arrays
are exactly the shapes `build-review-html.py` already reads (`reference/content-schema.md`).
No renderer changes: the file is a new *source* for the piles, not a new pile.

Two decisions worth stating, because both are load-bearing:

* **Hand-rolled, no PyYAML.** The frontmatter is `key: value` lines and nothing else. A YAML
  parser would accept nine spellings of the same thing plus one spelling of something subtly
  different, and would be a dependency on the machine of every trainee who installs this.
* **Strict and loud, never lenient and quiet.** An unknown section heading, an unknown field
  key, a field after the prose: all hard errors, because a pile the parser skipped reads on
  the page exactly like a pile nobody wrote, and those are the two things a reviewer most
  needs told apart. `--check` runs the same parse and writes nothing, so the agent can be
  told to validate the file *before* committing it.

Exit codes:  0 parsed · 3 no such file · 4 unparseable · 5 present, and every item
unanchored — a file that says nothing, reported as that rather than as a clean review ·
6 the report does not match `reference/review-points.schema.json`.

Usage:
  review-points.py --check                    # validate, print what was understood
  review-points.py                            # write .human-review/review-points.json
  review-points.py --root ../repo --file docs/review-points.md --out /tmp/rp.json
