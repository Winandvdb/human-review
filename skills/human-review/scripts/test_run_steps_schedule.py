"""The producers run in parallel — within what they read from each other and what they hold.

Serial, they took 8.3 min on petclinic; most of that was four steps that never wait for one
another. These tests pin the two rules that make running them at once safe: a step starts
only after the steps it NEEDS, and never alongside a step that USES the same resource
(the commit's Docker stack, the Maven build directory).
