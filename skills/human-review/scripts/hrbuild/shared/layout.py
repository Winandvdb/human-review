"""The tab layout and the scope bar are the skill's, not the content file's.

Every tab after Review shows something a script produced — the film, the REST contract,
the diagram deltas, the matrix, the city, the audit, the bars, the logging scan, the owners
check. Which blocks those tabs carry, and what the script-produced sections include and
embed, is therefore a fact about the skill, the same on every branch. It used to be
re-typed into `content.json` by whichever model ran the review, off an example in
`reference/content-schema.md`, and a model that improvised produced a different page:

- an API tab of four sections — its own prose and snippet on top, then the text diff, the
  compatibility table and the pb33f report — instead of the verdict band over the visual
  diff;
- a Data tab with a section of its own (*"Page first, associations second"*, prose and two
  hand-picked snippets) between the generated diagrams and the conceptual model;
- a Demo tab declared with no blocks, which the build drops as empty — so the one tab whose
  absence most needs explaining (no film) vanished instead of saying why;
- a scope chip `gate green: CI for 7f71…`, true of every page that exists at all, since a
  red gate means there is no page.

So the build normalises all of it before anything renders, and says on stderr what it threw
away. The content file still names the tabs (and so still carries the Review tab's ledes,
each tab's hover, and the few per-branch selections a script cannot make — which diagrams;
not which tests to quote beside their sequences, which the build reads off the diagrams and
the tags), but a script-owned tab keeps only blocks of
the kinds its scripts produce, its sections are rebuilt from `SECTIONS`, and a chip that is
not computed does not reach the bar.
