"""The gate, then the wipe, then the run's start markers — in that order, or not at all.

A review of a branch that does not build is worse than no review: it is a confident-looking
guide about code nobody has proven compiles, with every number on it measured from a tree of
unknown status. So the branch is pushed and the build for the *exact commit that was pushed*
must be green before anything else happens.

The order is the substance of this script, and it is why it is a script:

  1. **gate** — push, then wait for green **for `$SHA`**, never for "the latest run on the
     branch". A branch almost always has some green run on it, which is what makes
     `gh run list --branch` so tempting and so wrong: it is the confidently-wrong signal
     this whole page exists to avoid. An empty run list is not a pass either — **absence is
     not success** — and a repository with genuinely no CI is let through only if the guide
     then says *"no build proved this"*.
  2. **wipe** — and only now (`assets/`, and the earlier builds' `*.out` logs beside the
     page). Every fragment producer writes to a fixed path and the
     renderer inlines whatever it finds with no freshness check, so a step that fails
     silently leaves the previous run's artifact in place: a green `compatible` seal for a
     diff it never saw. Because the wipe is destructive, it comes *after* the gate — a run
     that stops at the gate leaves the previous guide intact instead of destroying it on the
     way out.
  3. **reset the ledger**, for the same reason and worse. A stale `.steps.json` parses
     perfectly: every tab it names is reported as measured, none of this run's turns fall
     inside last run's windows, and the page prints a confident **`$0.00`** against every
     tab. That reads as "this run was free", not as "we did not measure".
  4. **start markers** — `.started` is what lets the page report what it cost; `.session` is
     what lets a later rebuild read the right transcript instead of publishing the wrong one.

The gate is about the branch **as pushed now, not the tree at the end of the run**. This
skill deliberately leaves the review's own fixes uncommitted for a human to inspect, so this
never means "push the review's fixes too".

**Which** build counts is configured, not guessed from whatever ran: a push triggers several
workflows, and a green Pages deploy proves nothing about the application. `--workflow` (or
`"ci": {"workflows": [...]}` in `human-review.json`) names the authoritative ones and **all**
of them must be green for the exact SHA. Unconfigured, the one workflow named like `ci`/`build`
is used; with none or several, every run on the SHA has to be green. A cancelled run, a
workflow that never got a runner, and GitHub not answering are reported as what they are —
none of them is a red build, and none of them is a pass. The decision lands in
`.human-review/.gate.json` (workflow, run id, SHA, verdict), on a refusal too.

Exit codes:  0 ready · 1 the gate refused · 2 misuse.

Usage:
  preflight.py --base origin/main
  preflight.py --base origin/main --workflow ci.yml
  preflight.py --no-gate          # local experiment; the guide must say the gate was skipped
