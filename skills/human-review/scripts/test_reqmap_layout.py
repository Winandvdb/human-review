"""The frame around the requirements↔tests matrix, which the build owns and the model does not.

`assets/requirements-map.html` is written by a paid run: which test covers which sentence
of the ticket, and how honestly. That is a judgement, and it is the model's. Where the two
columns sit, which key goes under which frame and what is written over the ticket is not a
judgement at all — it is the same answer on every branch — and a layout that came back
subtly different after each run was a page the reader had to learn again.

`hrbuild/tabs/tests.py:reqmap_layout` takes that frame back on every build. This file is
what holds it: that the pieces move where they were asked to move, that the ticket's title
is resolved from GitHub and never read off the model's HTML, that the two frames start on
one line, and — the part worth as much as the rest — that a fragment it does not recognise
comes back byte for byte.
