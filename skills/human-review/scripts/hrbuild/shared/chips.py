# file resolved by a package manager -- and none of it is code a reviewer reads.
#
# Counting them does not merely inflate the number, it inverts it. On the branch this was
# written for, one regenerated `endpoint-complexity.json` supplied 1405 of 2896 added
# lines, and the redrawn `.genseq.*` pairs supplied almost every deletion: a reviewer
# reading `-333 lines` was reading a diagram being redrawn, not a line of logic being
# removed. The chip is there to say how much there is to read, and a number dominated by
# machine output answers a different question than the one being asked.

# `exclude` in the content file adds to this list; it never replaces it. There is no way
