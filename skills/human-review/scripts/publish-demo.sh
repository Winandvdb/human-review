publish-demo.sh — stage a /human-review snapshot for GitHub Pages

Usage:
  publish-demo.sh [slug] [source-dir] [--card] [--push]
  publish-demo.sh --help

Arguments:
  slug          Directory name under demo/ to publish as, e.g. demo.
                Letters, digits, dashes and underscores only. Defaults to the name of
                the project the snapshot belongs to — the source directory's parent.
  source-dir    The snapshot directory to copy (default: .human-review), the one
                holding review.html, content.json and assets/.

Options:
  --src DIR     The source directory, when you want the slug left to default.
  --card        Write this snapshot's card into demo/index.html, rendered from the
                snapshot itself. Implied by --push.
  --push        Commit the snapshot and the landing page, and push.
  --feature     Make this snapshot the featured one: the one the README's tour, the
                per-tab pages under docs/tabs/ and the top of the Pages landing page show.
  --no-tour     Publish without retaking the tour's screenshots, even for the featured
                snapshot.

The featured snapshot (the README's `featured-demo` marker names it; `demo` today) is
screenshotted tab by tab on every publish — with --card or --push — and the README, the
docs/tabs/ pages and the landing page's top block are rewritten around the new pictures,
so none of them can show an older page than the one just published.

Environment:
  HUMAN_REVIEW_REPO   Checkout of victorrentea/human-review to copy into.
                      Default: ~/workspace/human-review

Without --push the script only copies files and prints the git commands to run once
you have looked at the result.
