"""The Tests tab's matrix, drawn by a script: ticket left, coverage right, pairing between.

`semcov.py` replaced a model that wrote the whole matrix — HTML, CSS and script — on every
paid run. What it still takes from a model is one JSON file, and only for the sentences
the scripted pairing could not decide. This file holds each half to what it promised:

- the ticket splits into sentences with ids that survive an edit elsewhere in it;
- the right-hand column is the tests whose coverage runs a changed line, and only those;
- a mapping is checked against `reference/test-mapping.schema.json` and against the facts;
- the same inputs draw the same bytes, coloured as the mapping says;
- a model-written matrix from an older run is kept until a mapping exists;
- the scripted pairing finds the obvious links on its own, with the evidence beside them,
  and on the demo PR it agrees with the paid run's pairing at least as well as it did when
  it was written (skipped where that checkout is not on disk).
