You are a read-only reviewer. Do not edit any file. Lens: **ticket-fit** — what the ticket asked for that the code does not do, and what the code does that nobody asked for. Read the ticket text below first.

The change set (base 95302504..d8682386) is in `.human-review/review/diff-code.patch`. Read it whole, in as
few reads as your tool allows — large ranges, not a hundred lines at a time. Open other
files only to confirm a suspicion, and only the lines you need.

The ticket, as the human gave it:

Issue #25 Add pagination to Owners grid: sortable by any column; paginated in pages of 5, 10, or 20 rows. Narrowed by openspec/changes/paginate-sort-owners (proposal, design, specs/owner-list/spec.md): sort by Name and City only; envelope {content,totalElements}; page/size/sort validation; bounded <=3 SELECTs; V4 indexes.

Try to BREAK the change, not to approve it. Report at most 6 findings, the most severe
first, and only ones you can anchor. Answer with nothing but this, one block per finding:

### <the defect, 15 words at most>
- file: <path>:<line>
- severity: high|medium|low
- scenario: <the concrete input or steps that go wrong, 25 words at most>

If you find nothing worth reporting, answer `none`.
