"""Ask a cheap model for the one judgement the Tests tab's matrix still needs, and nothing else.

`refresh-report.py` is the machine half of `/human-review`: fixed inputs, fixed outputs,
free, safe to run again at any time. This is the other half, reduced to the smallest thing
that can still be a *command*. The matrix used to be all of it — a model wrote
`assets/requirements-map.html` and a `test-index/` catalogue, layout and CSS included, at
$4–$10 a run. Now `semcov.py` draws the matrix and proposes pairings on its own, from shared
evidence — but a shared word is a *candidate*, not proof: run 5 painted "sortable by any
column" green over a test that checks the page size. So this program asks a model, in one
call, to confirm or reject every link the script made (one line of reason each), to pair
the sentences the script could not, and to mark a sentence a recorded scope decision
narrowed — and writes the answer, `test-mapping.json`, checked against
`reference/test-mapping.schema.json`. The build merges it in; without it no scripted link
is shown as covering anything.

The Demo film's script, the other model-written artifact, has a sibling of this program:
`rerun-film.py`, which borrows its plumbing (`claude_argv`, `_priced`, `record_run`).

Five properties are the whole point:

- **A cheap model, named here.** `haiku` by default: choosing among eight tests for a
  sentence is not work that needs more. `--model`, `"mappingModel"` in the repository's
  `human-review.json`, or `$HUMAN_REVIEW_MAPPING_MODEL` change it. Its price lands on the
  cost tab through `.model-runs.json`, read off the CLI's own `total_cost_usd`.
- **Every scripted link is a candidate, and the model confirms or rejects each one** — with
  the open sentences, in the same single call. Only a ticket with no claim in it at all gets
  an empty answer written and no model run.
- **What it claims is checked by passes that can only lower it.** Eval run 8's Haiku answer
  called 25 of 27 sentences covered and none partial. A free script rule drops a link whose
  test shares nothing specific with its sentence (`semcov.sanity`) — unless the model quoted
  the assertion line and it is in the body, and never down to red on its own; a second cheap call
  re-reads every kept link against the test body and must quote the assertion line, looked
  up in the real body (`matrix-check-prompt.md`, `semcov.apply_check`). Neither ever adds a
  link or raises a coverage word. `--no-check` / `"mappingCheck": false` skips the second.
- **The previous answer is kept**, under `.human-review/.model-prev/`. Dot-prefixed,
  because `publish-demo.sh` publishes what does not start with a dot.
- **It refuses rather than half-writes.** An answer that is not JSON, fails the schema,
  names a sentence it was not asked about or a test it was not shown, or claims a coverage
  its own links cannot stand behind, is not written: this exits non-zero, says why, and the
  file on disk stays what it was.

    rerun-model.py                      # confirm/reject the scripted links, pair the rest
    rerun-model.py --dry-run            # print the command and what is open, spend nothing
    rerun-model.py --prompt-only        # the whole prompt on stdout, for another harness
    rerun-model.py --answer reply.json  # validate and install an answer made elsewhere

`--prompt-only` and `--answer` are how a session that is not Claude Code runs this step:
GitHub Copilot picks its cheap model itself (*Auto*, or `gpt-5-mini`), so it reads the
prompt, answers it, and hands the answer back here to be checked and written.

`--dry-run` is not a nicety either: every test of this file, and every check that the
button is wired to the right program, runs through it. Nothing below it may cost money.
