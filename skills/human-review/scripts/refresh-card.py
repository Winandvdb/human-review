"""Redraw one draw.io card and put it back into the finished page, in place.

What the card's green ring runs (`diagrams.card_rerun_html`, served by `serve-review.py`):

    refresh-card.py --dir .human-review --name conceptual

The reader has just moved a box in draw.io and wants to see it on the page. The tab's own
ring answers that by re-deriving the whole tab — on the Data tab every PlantUML delta as
well, thirty seconds of renders nothing changed — and then rebuilding the whole page,
another ten. Forty seconds for one dragged box, and the reload lands them at the top of
the card they were looking at. This does the part of that which can have changed:

1. **the one `drawio-diff.py`** the card was drawn by, exactly as it ran last time — the
   command its verdict recorded (`<name>-diff.json`, `rerun`). In-process when it is the
   one beside us, so the interpreter starts once. Its exports come out of draw.io's
   render cache when the same XML was drawn before (the base side always is);
2. **the card**, rendered by the same functions the build renders it with and passed
   through the same per-card rewrites the build gives it afterwards — the prompt pill and
   the (i), the short file name, the page-wide link and tooltip rewrites — so the markup is
   the markup a full build writes (`test_refresh_card.py` holds the two to equality);
3. **the splice**: the card's old markup in `review.html` is replaced by the new, read and
   written back in one go (the file is re-read right before the write and replaced
   atomically, so nothing written to the page meanwhile is lost); the manifest entries the
   card declares are merged into `.actions.json` the same way. The new card is also left at
   `.card-<name>.html`, where the server picks it up for the page to swap in without a
   reload.

When the edit changes something outside the card — the drawing became identical to the
base, or stopped being, which strikes the tab through or un-strikes it — or the card cannot
be found on the page, it rebuilds the whole page instead, with the command the page was
built by. Slower, never wrong.
